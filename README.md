Luftkampf
=========

My first game I made with Apples Sprite Kit and the help of one tuts+ tutorial.


Gameplay
=========

You controle your plain with the accelerometer and shoot by taping the screen. Your enemys are spawning in a random
position on top of the screen. You die if you get hit by an enemy bullet or an enemy plan.
You have on shield, which regenerates every 10 kills, that blocks one bullet.
You earn better shoots by killing enemys. If you can kill 20 enemy plans a mighty boss will apear.

Have fun, and don't get fustrated to quickly.
